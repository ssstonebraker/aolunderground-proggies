'  Listen up people, I could give a fuck less what you add to this module,
'  however, I do not want you removing ANYTHING from it!
'  Upon removing something, you risk ruining this whole damn module!
'  Everything, especially the "little shit" in this module is used, subs
'  are used with other subs, functions with sub, subs with functions,
'  functions with functions!  So just leave the existing code as is.
'  P.S. I'm not even gonna ask for greets in yo shit cause
'  No one ever adds the module maker to their greets.
'  ***NOTES***
'  (1)  There are 3 string functions sampled from Dos32.bas.
'  (2)  All the fade functions WERE writeen by me (Hoax).
'         I know the layout of the fade functions looks just like
'         they were taken from monkefade3.bas, but they weren't.
'         There is a formula to fades, and thats what I used,
'         Monkegod's formulas, thats it.  To proove that I did
'         NOT take his fades, you can look at my LaggIt function
'         and my ALLFX function.
'  (3)  I took one thing from someone else...the TOS_Phrases.
'         They were part of the Rampage Toolz 1.0 source code.
'         I used to use the modules from that source, but as you
'         can plainly see, I did not do the same with this module.
'  (4)  There are many functions and constants that work/do the
'         same thing as other functions/constants.  This is because
'         this module has been revised, edited, restarted, and revived
'         so many times that I ended up adding things twice without
'         knowing it.  Don't remove the constants/functions that
'         are duplicated.  They are extremely needed for other functions/subs/constants.
