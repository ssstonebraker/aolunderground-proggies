'there are alot of subs/functions that i define
'and tell what does what...there are some that dont
'if u scroll down you will see that the first i dont know
'about 50 or so i guess give descriptions to what does
'what...if it doesnt and you dont understand look at
'ones that do

'*buggy*
'about RunToolbar
'to understand how to use it you must understand what
'numbers and letters are in what sections
'take a look at your aol screen... see where it says
'mail (then a down arrow) that is 0
'people(then down arrow) that is 1
'aolservices(down arrow) that is 2
'settings (down arrow) that is 3
'favorites(down arrow) that is 4
'for the letters its pretty simple...find what you want
'to go to, look at what letter is underlined
'thats the letter you will use in code.
'ex: People and Down to Find A Chat
'Call RunToolbar("1", "F")
'the '1' is section People, the F is the letter its
'going to , pretty simple, enjoy that

'I didnt dim everything it takes up to much time, same
'reason i didnt give a description for everything.
'basically for all the coding here if it says sub or function
'not defined you either need to dim it by doing this:
