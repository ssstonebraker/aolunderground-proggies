'||     Info: 134 Procedure and subs in WinAss.bas                          ||
'|| Comments: First of all,  i would like to say that i did not type all    ||
'||          this bullshit out.  i took it from other bas files.            ||
'||          And i'd like to give props out to all the people who made      ||
'||          these functions (even though they problably copied them too).  ||
'||          Another thing, if something goes wrong and you cannot get a    ||
'||          function to work, it's your fault, it's not because i          ||
'||          miss-programmed the damn thing.  You should know what u to do  ||
'||          if you get an error. That is all.                              ||
