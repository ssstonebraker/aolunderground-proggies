'hey all
'this is naÔve again. this is an update of my original bas's, Utilsπ and Utils≤
'it has a large number of new subs, and some are getting the axe
'sorry bout any errors and old bad style, this bas was first started over 2 years ago
'i did compile it and i found all the errors there and fixed them, so this bas can now be compiled
'also note the option explicit up there, all vars in this bas are defined! lol.
'sorry i left that out in the early vers, but i hadn't been proggin long

'this update has 201 total subs with 72 new subs and many revised ones.
'i tried to remember to mark the new subs, but i know i forgot some. see if you notice any i didnt mark.
'nearly 80% of the subs in the bas were changed a little bit. it needed it. this bas
'should run much better now!
'check out my superfast CountLines sub and the SaveUnlimitedLists/LoadUnlimitedLists,
'i think they are the best and most useful

'as far as i know, the code in this bas is 99.5% original, i think there is one sub by monkegod in here, any i copied is marked
' (there is very litle)
'i coded it from the declarations on
'it has been a product of 2+ years work. i think the original utils bas was made about a year
'after i began proggin, 'more than 2+ years ago, i dont know the exact date. i have no problem with people
'using subs from this bas in their own work, but you must give me credit. thats the way things should work.

'im very proud of this bas, so if you use it or  if you like it contact me
'aim: lazy naive
'email: george@george.cx
'feel free to this file, just email me and give me the url.
'peace-
'naÔve

'Peace To Unity!
