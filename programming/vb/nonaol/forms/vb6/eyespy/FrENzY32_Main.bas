'We'll Do 3 Labels (9Bars) Used In Fade3Colors
'Make 3 Labels And Name Them Color1, Color2, And Color3
'Make 9 ScrollBars
'Set The Property "Max" to 255
'Then Put Them Next To Each Other With A Space Every 3 Bars
'The First 3 Bars Name Red1, Green1, Blue1
'Then Double Click On Red1
'GoTo The The Drop Menu Next To Proc:
'Go Down To Scroll
'And Put This In There
'Color1.BackColor = rgB(Red1.value, Green1.value, Blue1.value)
'Do The Same To Blue1 And Green1
'Now Do The Same To Red2, Green2, Blue2(Which Are The Next 3 Scroll Bars)
'Then Put That Code In The Scroll Statement Except Change It To
'Color2.BackColor = rgB(Red2.value, Green2.value, Blue2.value)
'And Repeat The Same With Red3, Green3, Blue3
'With This Lesson You Can Make A 10 Color Scroller Also
